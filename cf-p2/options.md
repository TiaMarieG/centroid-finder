Tia's Research

I looked into a few charting libraries and the three I settled on are XChart, JFreeChart, and Plotly.

XChart

Pros:
Super basic - Doesn't require much setup before it's good to go
Beginner friendly - It being super basic means we don't have to worry about a ton of different options
Documentation - There's a lot of documentation so if we do get stuck, we'll be able to find a fix without much hassle

Cons:
Super basic - As much as it's a pro, it's also a con. Not as diverse as some other charting libraries so options are limited

JFreeChart

Pros: 

More diverse than XChart, but still pretty beginner friendly
Similar documentation to XChart - A lot of provided info to help us in case we get stuck

Cons:

Since it offers more features than XChart, even though it's still basic it can get confusing

Plotly

Pros:

It's web-based which I think is important since we'll be pairing our project with React
Super customizable and works great with animations which we might need for salamander tracking

Cons:

Doesn't seem very beginner friendly
Super customizable is also a con because we can get confused very quickly
Requires us to use a Rest API which could be an added hassle
